 We have been entrusted with a dataset containing information from ten candidates. This dataset encompasses a variety of data points, including scores related to the candidates' emotional expressions, evaluations of their spoken transcripts, and the actual transcripts themselves, extracted from their introductory videos. Our primary goal is to undertake a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to unearth valuable insights and discern patterns within this dataset. This analysis will serve as a crucial step in making informed decisions about whether these candidates should be considered for recruitment based on data-driven insights. Our focus will be on gaining a comprehensive understanding of the emotional expressions exhibited by the candidates, evaluating their communication skills, and identifying desirable areas of expertise from their educational background, skills, and experience as mentioned in the transcripts.ideo_resume_evaluation
